        <p class="paragraph">The Winchester Brothers are two hunters raised from childhood to fight the
        supernatural. The person who trained them was none other than their now-late
        father, John Winchester. Now, with over 30 years of experience, the Winchesters
        continue their father's legacy by fighting the creatures of the night and darkness.</p>

      <div class="panel2-content">
        <p class="paragraph">Dean Winchester was born on the 24<sup>th</sup> of January on the year 1979. Sam
        Winchester was born on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of May in 1983. Only after 6 months passed since Sam's birth
        did their lives change forever.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">On the night of the 2<sup>nd</sup> of November in the same year of Sam's birth,
        a yellow-eyed demon came in to Sam's room. Sam started crying at the sight. This made his mother, Mary
        Winchester, wake up and check on him, only to find the yellow-eyed demon above the baby. When John
        was the next to wake, he went to Sam's room to find Mary pinned to the ceiling. But, immediately after
        seeing her, fire started to emerge from behind her. Dean then came into the room and was given his little
        brother, and was told by John to take him and go as fast as he could.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">That was the day John Winchester swore to find the yellow-eyed demon and kill him.
        Ever since then, the life of the Winchesters was full of travel, bloodspill, and terror.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">Their father was killed by the same yellow-eyed demon they tracked for years, but the
        brothers finished their father's job in his place and killed the yellow-eyed demon. Now, they bring death
        to those supernatural beings that wreak havoc and terror</p>
