      <h4>SURVIVAL TIPS &amp; TRICKS</h4>
      <p>We can't be solving every case everywhere at the same time, so here are
      some helpful tips to keep yourself safe from the monsters until we get there.</p>

        <h5>Salt</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-content">
        <img src="images/salt.png" alt="Salt"/>
        <p>Salt, most commonly used against ghosts and demons, our most usual case. It's just a good thing to have
        in general. it can be an extra to your food or add some extra years to your life.<br/>
        <br/>Whenever there's cold spots, the best thing to do is to put a salt circle around the whole
        family. That'll keep the ghost away. And, if they show up, go throw some salt on them. It'll buy
        some time. It'll also knowck a ghost right out of the body it's possessing.<br/>
        <br/>Own a rifle? Make some salt rounds to shoot those sons of bitches with. It'll buy more time
        than just sprinkling on them.</p>

        <h5>Iron</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-content">
        <img src="images/iron.jpg" alt="Iron"/>
        <p>Iron, another good ghost repellant, just less available than salt. Still, one touch of this and
        it'll also knock the spirit out of the body it's possessing.<br/>
        <br/>Always have some kind of iron object like an iron bar, iron knucles, just about anything made
        of pure iron will work.<br/>
        <br/>Iron is also used against other creatures, such as fairies, phoenixes, acheris, and many others.
        They can also be used to block witches' powers, though you'd need things like iron cuffs.</p>

        <h5>Silver</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-content">
        <img src="images/silver.jpg" alt="Silver"/>
        <p>Silver, an effective tool in repelling <em>and</em> deflecting supernatural creatures. It has a
        large scope of creatures that it affects. Just a touch usually already harms a monster. Silver knives
        are the best weapon to have against those weak to silver.<br/>
        <br/>It'll work against shapeshifters, fairies, revenants, and, of course, werewolves.</p>

        <h5>Devil's Trap</h5>
      </div>
      <div class="tips-content">
        <img src="images/devilstrap.jpg" alt="Devil's Trap"/>
        <p>Afraid of demons? Here's a simple solution: The Devil's Trap.<br/>
        <br/>There are plenty of places you can place these sigils. One good place is under your living room
        rug. That'll keep your house nice and safe while not conflicting with your design taste. If you're
        on the go and afraid of attacks, put a devil's trap on the ceiling of your vehicle. That way, the demon
        will be trapped in your car while you escape. Just hope they don't ruin your car.<br/>
        <br/>You could also carve them on handcuffs, but it's gonna take some good amount of strength and/or
        cunning to cuff a demon.</p>
